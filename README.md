#Introduction
This project is designed to apply various machine-learning techniques to analyze trends and make predictions. The notebook includes methods like ARIMA, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

#Data Loading
The dataset will be automatically downloaded from the provided Kaggle link in the relevant cell of the notebook. Make sure you have configured your Kaggle API token properly in your working environment.

#Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes:

Handling missing values.
Normalizing and scaling data.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.

#Machine Learning Models
The notebook implements the following models:

ARIMA: Time series forecasting.
Random Forest: Ensemble learning method for regression.
Gradient Boosting: Boosted decision tree model.
Linear Regression: Basic regression model.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Regression using support vectors.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Neural network for time series data.

#Results and Evaluation
Each model is evaluated based on:

Mean Squared Error (MSE).
ROOT Mean Square Error(RMSE)
